# Usage

**UPDATE**: _converting to flexboxes for maximum UI flexibility, see flex branch for latest changes.  Will release soon_

Highlights an array of instructions.  Glows.  Is somewhat efficient.  Uses [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/).

Example:

````html
<silicon-instructions instructions="[[instructions]]"></silicon-instructions>
````

Works well with [silicon-disassembler](http://github.com/m4b/silicon-disassembler).

See [documentation](http://m4b.github.io/silicon-instructions) for more information and a demo.

# TODO

* Allow memory on/off option?
